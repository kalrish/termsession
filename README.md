termsession
================================================================================

You encode your terminal session in YAML. `termsession` creates a [`.desktop` file](https://standards.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/latest/) for your session manager to launch it [automatically](https://standards.freedesktop.org/autostart-spec/autostart-spec-latest.html). Everyone's happy.
